### 1. Discovery (Scan for Unused Assets)
- “I will perform a full‑scale cleanup of the codebase, removing any files or scripts not actually used.”
- **Gather file list**: use `list_files` to enumerate all source code, scripts, assets, configs, and docs.
- **Map references**:
  - For each source file, run `search_code` to find import/require/include references.
  - For scripts (e.g. `scripts/*.sh`, `package.json` entries), check if invoked by any build or CI config.
  - For assets (images, styles, templates), search for usage in code or markup.
- **Identify orphans**: mark files with zero references in codebase, CI/CD, or config.

---

### 2. Plan Cleanup (≤4 bullets)
1. Remove orphaned source files (not imported anywhere).  
2. Delete unused scripts (not listed in build pipelines or `package.json`/`Makefile`).  
3. Prune stale assets (images, CSS, templates with no usage).  
4. Consolidate or archive large legacy directories if still partly needed.

> If YOLO_MODE=off, present this plan and await approval; else proceed.

---

### 3. Clean (Apply Removals & Refactors)
For each orphan or candidate:
1. **Confirm context**: `read_file` or open file to verify it’s not referenced.
2. **Remove file**: use `delete_file` to delete it from disk.
3. **Update config**: remove related entries from `package.json`, CI YAML, or docs.
4. **Refactor imports**: if a module was partially orphaned, adjust imports or move shared code.
5. **Commit checkpoint** (optional): group related removals into logical commits.

> Always “Read Before Delete” to avoid removing needed files.

---

### 4. Validate (Build & Test Loop)
- **Run build**: `<build_command>` to ensure compilation succeeds.
- **Run tests**: `<test_command>` to verify no regressions.
- **Lint/Type‑check**: `<lint_command>` / `<type_check>` to catch leftover references.
- **If failures occur**:
  - Diagnose missing file errors or broken imports.
  - Restore or adjust removals (return to step 3).
  - Repeat until clean.

> Wrap commands in `timeout 30s … | cat` to avoid hangs.

---

### 5. Report (Summary)
In chat, provide:
- Removed items: list each deleted file or script.
- Updated configs: list modified build/CI entries.
- Status: “Build OK, tests passing, no import errors.”
- Any recommendations (e.g. “Consider archiving legacy dir `old_utils/` instead of deleting”).

> Keep it concise—no full logs or diffs.

### 6. Context Update (Persistence)
- **context.json**: update with  
  ```json
  {
    "last_task": "Project‑scale cleanup",
    "summary": "Removed X unused files, Y scripts; build & tests clean.",
    "next_steps": [ ... ]
  }
