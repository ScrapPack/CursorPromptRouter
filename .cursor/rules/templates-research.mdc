# Research Mode Template

## Overview
For technology research, proof of concepts, and analysis of tools, libraries, or approaches. Use when investigating new technologies, comparing alternatives, or conducting feasibility studies.

## Execution Workflow

### 1. Define Objectives & Scope  
- Restate goal: "I will research <RESEARCH_TOPIC> to understand its benefits, trade‑offs, and applicability."  
- **Key questions** (≤4 bullets):  
  1. What problem(s) does <RESEARCH_TOPIC> solve?  
  2. How does it compare to existing solutions?  
  3. What are maturity, community, and ecosystem factors?  
  4. What integration challenges or prerequisites exist?

> If YOLO_MODE=off, present this objectives list and await approval; else proceed.

### 2. Information Gathering  
- **Primary sources**: locate official docs, whitepapers, and specification (use `web_search`).  
- **Secondary sources**: find tutorials, benchmark reports, and community discussions (blogs, Stack Overflow).  
- **Real‑world examples**: identify notable projects or companies using <RESEARCH_TOPIC>.

### 3. Analysis & Comparison  
- **Core features & capabilities**: summarize main characteristics and key APIs/constructs.  
- **Comparison matrix**: contrast <RESEARCH_TOPIC> vs. at least two alternatives on criteria such as performance, learning curve, and ecosystem.  
- **Integration considerations**: note required infrastructure, tooling, or architecture changes.

### 4. Pros, Cons & Risks  
- **Advantages**: list top 3 strengths and use cases.  
- **Drawbacks**: list top 3 limitations or pitfalls.  
- **Risks**: identify potential adoption barriers (e.g. vendor lock‑in, security concerns).

### 5. Recommendations & Next Steps  
- **Suitability**: advise on scenarios where <RESEARCH_TOPIC> is a good fit.  
- **Proof‑of‑Concept plan**: outline a small experiment or prototype to validate key aspects.  
- **Learning resources**: suggest tutorials, courses, or sample repos for hands‑on exploration.

### 6. Context Update (Persistence)  
- **context.json**: write  
  ```json
  {
    "last_task": "Research <RESEARCH_TOPIC>",
    "summary": "Key findings on <RESEARCH_TOPIC>: pros, cons, and recommended next steps.",
    "next_steps": ["Prototype integration", "Evaluate performance in our environment"]
  }
  ```

## Key Principles
- Objective analysis - present balanced view of pros and cons
- Multiple sources - don't rely on single information source
- Practical focus - emphasize real-world applicability
- Compare alternatives - always evaluate against existing solutions
- Actionable insights - provide clear next steps and recommendations
