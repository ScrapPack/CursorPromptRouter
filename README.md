[MODE: Request] Add user authentication to the API
[MODE: Question] How does dependency injection work?
[MODE: Debug] The login form is not working
[MODE: Setup] Initialize a new React project
[MODE: Documentation] Create API documentation
[MODE: Clean] Remove unused imports from src/
[MODE: TestCoverage] Add unit tests for user service
[MODE: SecurityAudit] Scan for vulnerabilities
[MODE: Optimize] Improve database query performance
```

**Benefits:**
- **100% accuracy** - Always routes to the correct mode
- **No ambiguity** - Eliminates confusion about intent
- **Consistent behavior** - Same result every time
- **Power user friendly** - Direct control over workflow selection

### Natural Language (Intent-Based)

For conversational interaction with 85-95% accuracy:

```
Add user authentication to the API
How does dependency injection work?
The login form is not working
Set up a new React project
Create documentation for the API
Update the database schema
Clean up unused code
Add tests for the API
Review the security implementation
```

### Context-Aware Examples

The router understands various context clues:

**Question Detection:**
```
"What is the best approach?" ‚Üí Question Mode (question mark)
"How do I implement this?" ‚Üí Question Mode (how + question mark)
"Is this secure?" ‚Üí Question Mode (is + question mark)
```

**File Type Context:**
```
"Check the README" ‚Üí Documentation Mode (file type context)
"Update the tests" ‚Üí TestCoverage Mode (test file context)

## üéØ How It Works

### Advanced Pattern Matching System

The router uses a sophisticated multi-layered pattern matching system with 85-95% accuracy:

#### Priority System (Highest to Lowest)

1. **Explicit Mode Tags** (100% Accuracy)
   - Always honored when present: `[MODE: Request] Add user authentication`
   - Recommended for power users and precise control
   - Bypasses all other pattern matching

2. **Phrase-Based Patterns** (Highest Accuracy)
   - Complete phrases for maximum precision
   - Examples: "performance is poor", "the app is broken", "what is the best way"
   - Reduces false positives from partial word matches

3. **Context Patterns** (High Priority)
   - Question marks (?), file types (.md, test files), technical terms
   - Examples: "?" ‚Üí Question Mode, "test" ‚Üí TestCoverage Mode, "deploy" ‚Üí Deploy Mode
   - Uses specific domain knowledge for accurate routing

4. **Intent Patterns** (Standard Priority)
   - Word-based patterns with word boundaries
   - Examples: "implement" ‚Üí Request Mode, "help" ‚Üí Help Mode, "research" ‚Üí Research Mode
   - Handles general intent classification

5. **Fallback Logic** (Lowest Priority)
   - Graceful degradation when intent is unclear
   - User confirmation for ambiguous cases
   - Default to Request mode for unclear cases

### Pattern Matching Algorithm

```
1. Check for [MODE: X] explicit tags
2. Test phrase-based patterns (complete phrases)
3. Check context patterns (question marks, file types, technical terms)
4. Match intent patterns (word-based with boundaries)
5. Apply fallback logic with user confirmation
6. Default to Request mode if still unclear
```

### Conflict Resolution

The system includes intelligent conflict resolution:

- **Question Words in Development Context**: Prioritizes development intent
- **Action Words**: "add", "create", "build" ‚Üí Request Mode
- **Problem Indicators**: "broken", "error", "not working" ‚Üí Debug/Refresh Mode
- **Documentation Keywords**: "docs", "README", "API docs" ‚Üí Documentation Mode
- **Testing Keywords**: "test", "coverage", "unit test" ‚Üí TestCoverage Mode
- **Security Keywords**: "security", "audit", "vulnerability" ‚Üí SecurityAudit Mode
- **Performance Keywords**: "performance", "optimize", "improve" ‚Üí Optimize Mode

### Intent Classification

The router understands different types of intents with high accuracy:

**Development Intents:**
- "I want to build/create/implement/update something" ‚Üí Request Mode
- "I need to start a new project" ‚Üí Setup Mode
- "I want to improve performance" ‚Üí Optimize Mode
- "I need to design the architecture" ‚Üí Architecture Mode

**Problem-Solving Intents:**
- "Something is broken/not working" ‚Üí Debug Mode
- "I need to fix an issue" ‚Üí Refresh Mode
- "I'm confused about how to proceed" ‚Üí Help Mode
- "There's an error in the code" ‚Üí Debug Mode

**Information Intents:**
- "I want to understand/learn about something" ‚Üí Question Mode
- "I need documentation" ‚Üí Documentation Mode
- "I want to research alternatives" ‚Üí Research Mode
- "What is the best approach?" ‚Üí Question Mode

**Quality & Maintenance Intents:**
- "I need to clean up the code" ‚Üí Clean Mode
- "I want to add tests" ‚Üí TestCoverage Mode
- "I need to review the code" ‚Üí Review Mode
- "I want to check security" ‚Üí SecurityAudit Mode

## üîß Configuration

### Customization

You can customize the router behavior by editing `.cursor/rules/template-router.mdc`:

- **Add new intent patterns** - Extend keyword matching for new modes
- **Modify phrase-based patterns** - Add complete phrases for higher accuracy
- **Adjust context patterns** - Customize file type and technical term detection
- **Change priority order** - Reorder pattern matching hierarchy
- **Customize confirmation prompts** - Modify user interaction messages

### Context File

The system maintains a `cursorContext.json` file to track:
- **Implementation summaries** - Brief descriptions of completed tasks
- **Usage statistics** - Mode usage patterns and frequency
- **Recent activities** - Last 10 tasks with timestamps
- **Mode preferences** - User behavior patterns for optimization

### Advanced Configuration

**Pattern Matching Customization:**
```regex
# Add new intent patterns
\b(your|new|keywords|here)\b

# Add phrase-based patterns
"your complete phrase here"

# Add context patterns
\?|your|context|indicators
```

**Priority System Modification:**
The priority order can be adjusted in the router configuration:
1. Explicit tags (always highest)
2. Phrase-based patterns
3. Context patterns
4. Intent patterns
5. Fallback logic

## üìù Coding Standards & Character Usage

### Special Character Guidelines

**‚ùå AVOID in Code and Scripts:**
- **Emojis** (üòÄ, üöÄ, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå, etc.) - Can cause encoding issues, parsing errors, and compatibility problems
- **Unicode symbols** (‚Üí, ‚Üê, ‚Üë, ‚Üì, etc.) - May not render correctly in all environments
- **Smart quotes** ("", '', etc.) - Use standard ASCII quotes instead
- **Special formatting characters** - Stick to basic ASCII for maximum compatibility

**‚úÖ USE ONLY in Documentation:**
- Emojis and special characters are acceptable in:
  - README files
  - Documentation files (.md, .txt)
  - Comments (sparingly)
  - User-facing content
  - Stylization purposes only

**Best Practices:**
- Use standard ASCII characters for all code, scripts, and configuration files
- Replace emojis with descriptive text (e.g., "PASS" instead of ‚úÖ, "FAIL" instead of ‚ùå)
- Use simple text indicators for status and progress
- Ensure all code works across different operating systems and environments
- Test scripts with basic ASCII characters only

**Examples:**

```bash
# ‚ùå Bad (in code/scripts):
Write-Host "‚úÖ Test passed!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "‚ùå Test failed!" -ForegroundColor Red

# ‚úÖ Good (in code/scripts):
Write-Host "PASS: Test completed successfully" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "FAIL: Test encountered an error" -ForegroundColor Red
```

```markdown
# ‚úÖ Acceptable (in documentation):

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Router Not Triggering

1. **Use explicit mode tags** - `[MODE: Request]` always works (100% reliable)
2. **Check for question marks** - "?" automatically triggers Question mode
3. **Try rephrasing** your request with clearer intent words
4. **Use the confirmation system** when presented with options
5. **Check for conflicting global rules** in Cursor settings

### Incorrect Mode Selection

1. **Use explicit mode tags** to override automatic selection
2. **Rephrase your request** with clearer intent words
3. **Use the confirmation system** to choose the correct mode
4. **Learn from the suggestions** for better future requests

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"update" goes to wrong mode:**
- "update the code" ‚Üí Request Mode (implementation)
- "How do I update this?" ‚Üí Question Mode (question mark overrides)

**Question words in development context:**
- "What is the best way to implement this?" ‚Üí Request Mode (development context prioritized)
- "What is dependency injection?" ‚Üí Question Mode (information seeking)

**Ambiguous requests:**
- Use explicit mode tags for clarity
- Rephrase with specific action words
- Use the confirmation system when prompted

### Performance Tips

1. **Use explicit mode tags** for consistent, fast routing
2. **Include question marks** for information requests
3. **Use specific action words** for implementation tasks
4. **Learn the confirmation system** for ambiguous cases
